## bug fixes

* `(LessKeys.mini in LessKeys.less) := true` did not actually minify completed css sources in recent releases. This release fixes that.

## new host

* this and all future releases will be published to [bintray](https://bintray.com/) under the [sbt-releases](https://bintray.com/sbt/sbt-plugin-releases) repository.

If you don't already have it, you will need to add the following to your sbt plugin definition

    resolvers += Resolver.url(
      "bintray-sbt-plugin-releases",
        url("http://dl.bintray.com/content/sbt/sbt-plugin-releases"))(
          Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
          
    resolvers += "softprops-maven" at "http://dl.bintray.com/content/softprops/maven"

Finally, bump the version of less-sbt you are using, and your in business again

    addSbtPlugin("me.lessis" % "less-sbt" % "0.2.2")
